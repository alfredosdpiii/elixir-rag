This is often used to chain together multiple operations in a clear and concise way.\n","\n","For example, if you have the functions `prev(arg1, arg2)` and `next(arg3, arg4)`, you can use the pipe operator to pass the result of `prev` as the first argument to `next`, like so:\n","\n","`prev(arg1, arg2) |> next(arg3, arg4)`\n","\n","Which is equivalent to:\n","\n","`next(prev(arg1, arg2), arg3, arg4)`\n","\n","The pipe operator is especially elegant when used to lay out pipelines over multiple lines.
